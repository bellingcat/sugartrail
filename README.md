Sugartrail is a network analysis and visualisation tool developed to make it easier and faster for researchers to explore connections between companies, officers and addresses within Companies House.

## Requirements

You will require an API key from Companies House to get data. First you will need to create a live application to get an API key which you can do by following the [Companies House guide](https://developer.company-information.service.gov.uk/how-to-create-an-application).

## No-Install Usage

A hosted demo of the Sugartrail dashboard can be accessed [here](https://stark-island-99644.herokuapp.com/) (might take a few seconds to load the page).
